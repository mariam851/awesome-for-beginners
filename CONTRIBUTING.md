# Contribution Guide & Guidelines üöÄ

Welcome to the **Awesome First Pull Request Opportunities** project! We're excited that you want to contribute.

This guide will help you get started contributing new repositories to the list.

It outlines the recommended order for tasks and assumes you have already identified a repository you wish to add. Check the **Repository Requirements** section to know what makes a good addition.

> _Note: This list is intended for substantial projects. Small personal projects added just to gain contributions are discouraged and may be rejected._

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Initial Checks

- **Search for Duplicates**: Check the current list and previous pull requests to avoid submitting duplicates.

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Repository Requirements

- **Reasonably Developed**: The repository should have a clear goal or function and enough commits/content to show progress. New repositories with very few commits may be rejected.  
- **Active Maintenance**: Ensure the repository is actively maintained.  
- **Appropriate Labels**: Issues must have beginner-friendly labels like `good-first-issue` or `low-hanging-fruit`. If the label is not obvious, confirm with the owner.  
- **Supportive Community**: The repository should have a friendly, responsive community.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Making Changes and Opening a Pull Request (PR)

### Step 1: Edit the `data.json` File on GitHub

1. Go to the [`data.json` file](https://github.com/MunGell/awesome-for-beginners/blob/main/data.json).  
2. Click the **"Edit"** button (pencil icon).  
3. Add your repository by copying an existing entry and filling in your own information. Check the following:  
   - **Direct Links**: Link directly to the repository. No tracking links.  
   - **Spelling & Grammar**: Proofread your addition.  
   - **No Trailing Whitespace**: Avoid extra spaces at the end of lines.  
   - **Single Addition**: Submit one repository per PR.  
   - **New Technologies**: You can add a new technology heading if necessary.

4. Add a clear commit message describing your change.  
5. Click **"Propose changes"** to create a new branch and open a PR.

### Step 2: Submitting a Pull Request

1. GitHub will guide you to create a PR.  
2. Make the title and description clear and descriptive.  
3. If your suggested repository uses a non-obvious beginner-friendly label, provide proof or confirmation.  
4. Submit the PR and wait for feedback from the maintainers.

### Step 3: Reporting an Issue

If you encounter a problem or have a suggestion that you don't want to implement yourself, open an issue and provide:  
- A clear description of the problem or suggestion.  
- The expected behavior (for feature requests or bug reports).  
- The current behavior (for bug reports).
